## Setup Required Data File

For security and privacy reasons, the user data JSON file is not included in the repository.
After cloning the project:

Navigate to the data/ directory.

Create a new file named UserData.json.

Structure your JSON like this:

```bash
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "status": "active",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01"

```
